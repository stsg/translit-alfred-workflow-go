# Transslit Alfred 3 workflow

This is rewritten version of [Alfred](https://alfredapp.com) 
["translit" workflow](https://github.com/stsg/translit-alfred-workflow).

It fix mistakes when entering cyrillic text in wrong input locale (english) and
automatically switches keyboard layout. In short it does the same as the 
[Punto Swither](https://yandex.ru/support/punto-mac/index.html) does.

To work correctly you need [input source switcher](https://github.com/vovkasm/input-source-switcher)
and Python3.
